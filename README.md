# üöÄ Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

This project demonstrates how to use a **pre-trained Faster R-CNN model** with a **ResNet-50-FPN backbone** to perform object detection on real-world images using PyTorch and OpenCV.

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple, yet effective object detection pipeline using a well-established deep learning model. The system reads an image, detects objects within it, and displays the results with bounding boxes and class labels.

## üß† Model Selection

I chose to use the **Faster R-CNN ResNet-50 FPN** model from `torchvision.models.detection`. This model strikes a great balance between detection accuracy and inference speed, making it ideal for general-purpose applications.

- Faster R-CNN is a two-stage detector known for its high accuracy.
- The ResNet-50 backbone provides strong feature extraction capabilities.
- Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) enhance detection performance on objects of different scales.

The model comes with **COCO-pretrained weights**, which helps in avoiding long training times while still achieving solid performance.

## üìä Dataset Choice

The model is pre-trained on the **COCO (Common Objects in Context)** dataset. COCO is a widely used benchmark dataset that includes:

- Over **330,000 images**
- More than **1.5 million annotated objects**
- **80 object categories** such as person, bicycle, car, bottle, etc.

Using a model trained on COCO allows for robust detection across a wide range of object types without additional data collection or labeling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Process

In this version of the project, I used the **COCO-pretrained Faster R-CNN model directly for inference**.

The training phase was skipped to save time and resources, as the default weights were already suitable for my target images. I made sure the images were properly preprocessed (resized, normalized) using the transformations provided by `torchvision`.

This approach keeps the project **simple, efficient, and ready to use**.

## üñºÔ∏è Demo

After running the script, the system:
- Loads an image from disk
- Performs object detection
- Draws bounding boxes and class labels
- Displays the final image using OpenCV

You can change the image path and threshold as needed.

## üè≠ Real-World Applications

This object detection system can be adapted for industrial and manufacturing use cases such as:

- Quality control: detecting defective or incomplete products on the production line  
- Packaging and sorting: identifying and directing items to the correct bins or stations  
- Safety compliance: verifying that workers wear proper safety equipment (e.g. helmets, vests)

With integration into real-time video systems, this solution can support automation, reduce human error, and improve operational efficiency.
